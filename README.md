Some scripts I use for auditing, research and lead generation.

You'll need to install Python >= 3.4

Get an API key from: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html

Download compare.py and alchemyAPI.py. Edit compare.py to add your key and urls.

Run from Python command line.

TODO: Command line options to 1) add a key (writes to text file) 2) Specify URLs 3) Do a full single page comparison.

### How to use FB graph API.gs: 

You'll need your ad accounts ID: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1492627900875762

Plug it into the function to identify your account. Then run the script once and check the logs for the auth URL. Paste that URL into the bar, login, done.

Set the function to 'add_date_conversion()' to a schedule. Run daily.

TODO: Create a sidebar and interface to better automate some of the functions. Look at a better way of filling in missing rows or checking dates. Better error reporting so when someone receives an email it's not just 'it's not working'.
